"I told my therapist that I was sexually abused today, the first time I ever told anyone",158,k44vyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultsurvivors/comments/k44vyt/i_told_my_therapist_that_i_was_sexually_abused/,14,1606798143,"I work in a mental hospital and I witnessed a client being overly sexual in a public place. This was a few days ago. I usually am able to shake off whatever I see quite quickly after work. Though, this was different. The past two nights I haven't been able to sleep right. I kept on having flashbacks to a sexual assault from when I was a child at night. My therapist asked me plain and simple, why this one incident (at work) was so emotional for me. I then admitted the truth. I started crying uncontrollably over video chat. God Almighty, I felt so stupid.

I remember the night so vividly but I pushed it to the back of my mind. Sometimes I struggle with the reality of it happening because it was so long ago. It was as real to me as it could be. I don't even want to share the information with my family because I just feel that it will retraumatize me. Questioning if what happened, really even did.

My extended family has a history of incest. Though, coming from an African family as a 1st generation kid, I don't think they'll even want to hear about it again. Many things are buried under the rug and never spoken of. Plus my parents are always defensive, I can only imagine wtf they would say to me.

Now, I understand why I have dealt with feelings of abandonment for so long. I told my wife (for the first time too) and she supports me. I never felt so hurt and free at the same time. I was going to take the night off tomorrow. Avoiding work but I have to talk to the client about their behavior. I wrote this I guess so I would not feel alone anymore.",2020-12-01 10:19:03
An Idea,141,lixnyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/lixnyd/an_idea/,51,1613238549,"Hello. My name is Birhanu Tesfahun and I wanted to promote an idea that I had. I am 14 and Ethiopian and I realized that the average person doesn't know enough about Africa and views Africa through a window that is distorted with prejudice and stereotypes. To try and change this I decided to start an Instagram account (called [afrikan\_facts](https://www.instagram.com/afrikan_facts/)) to teach the online community about African news, culture, and history.

This is a new account so I only have one post. I have two reasons for making this post on Reddit.

1) I wanted to ask for you to follow and help this community grow.

2) I wanted to ask if any of you were interested in helping me.

I am currently the only person working on this project and I do not feel I will be able to do it justice by myself. I am looking for people who are willing to be my researchers. A researcher would research anything that interests them (International and African News, African food, African clothing, African cultures, etc.) and write it down on a doc (with their source) they would then share this doc with me through the account Gmail ([afrikanfacts@gmail.com](mailto:afrikanfacts@gmail.com)). A researcher would only need to do this once a week.

If you are interested in participating, please send me an email or DM me on Instagram. Thank you.",2021-02-13 23:19:09

I’ve been feeling so down recently as I’m trying to find myself right now, what I want to do with my life. I’m really lonely right now. And I’m trying to find out the root of this issue. And sometimes I just miss Nigeria. I’ve only been abroad for four years, but I miss my home so much. I’m sorry if I sound so ungrateful, one if my friends in Nigeria told me to stop crying, and that where I’m going is so much better than where I am right now. The Dream, where people make it. And I believed everyone. I want to believe everyone. I want to be successful and happy and mad everyone proud of me, because my parents sacrificed so much for this. I’m in a university, trying to work towards a good job, but I don’t know what to do with myself. I feel this hole in my heart. I almost worked myself to death last year, and now I’m struggling in every aspect of my life. I know I want to go back to Nigeria. I wanted to be an business owner (making graphic novels that took place in Nigeria, appreciating our cultures, and giving children a chance to see more Nigerian representation) or a politician that would bring change to our country, even if I had to die for that, to help out any way I can. But everyone discouraged me from that. Everyone told me to study, and someone i knew tried to set up a business in Nigeria and failed, everyone kept telling me that. But that was something I really wanted to do. I thought that if I tried hard enough that maybe it’s possible. But I think I might have to let it go now, because I have nobody to support me on this and nowhere to start. But I know if I give up on this, if I stay abroad, I would lose a part of myself. I feel like I always have to pretend, to put up a front with people, but when I was in Nigeria I felt happy, I felt like myself, despite all the money problems my family went through. Despite all of that, I was happy. I miss my friends. I miss everything. I’m sorry for sounding ungrateful, and tus is a very stupid post...I’m very sorry. I’ve been keeping this to myself, and I don’t know if I can keep it to myself anymore. I am grateful for everything my parents have done for me, I just miss my country.

Our leaders aren’t just mystical evil monsters from no where. They are fellow Nigerians like you and I who were raised in our culture. A racist society will produce a racist leader like Nazi germany and hitler, so will a tribalistic and corrupt society yield tribalistic and corrupt leaders like we have in Nigeria. It’s really comes down to societal mindset. I was thinking about some of the worst pet peeves about Nigerian “culture” and I’ll list them out. 
-the discipline: in some private and public Nigerian schools, teachers can hit children. This is barbaric. You can’t talk to an adult without being accused of being “rude”. This is how the police and military use brute force on citizens who they view as inferior to them. This is how our leaders view us too. 
-lack of pride: also in Nigerian culture, we don’t have a sense of nationalism. Most people would rather identify with foreigners than fellow countrymen. It’s sad. Nigerians will mock you for having a Nigerian accent. “You sound too Igbo” “you have h-factor”, etc. meanwhile they try and FAIL at faking a British/ American accent to prove their educated or “posh”. Heck even our HAIR. In Nigerian schools there’s sooo many laws on our hair- can’t have locs, girls MUST braid their hair, boys have to cut it short. Why not just let children pride themselves in their natural hair/hairstyles. 

That’s all I can think off right now and this is already long but you can add more in the comments.",2020-12-16 11:02:59

The hero also wants to save humanity from destroying itself in the long term and he creates a parody church (full of scientists and eventually turning into a political party) for that purpose.

Its point of view is strongly secular and environmentalist, but unlike other environmentalists, the heroes in this story are not averse to dirty tricks of their own, so long as they don't betray their goal in the long run and stay afloat by managing sources of revenue effectively.",2021-04-24 0:55:21

From Rwanda to Mozambique to Ethiopia to Ghana to Senegal, Africa is becoming safer, less risky, and more attractive. 

Economies can only grow at 10% for so long before they start doubling, and competing with the big boys. 

Chinese investment is often a mixed bag and say what you wil, **but** the crazy growth in infrastructure (highways, rail, dams, refineries, ports) is incredible, and makes doing business so much easier. Sometimes, making a slight loss on a highway can mean a net gain elsewhere. 

I am setting up a business venture in Kenya now with my local partner and friend. I have several more opportunities in Kenya and Malawi. 

People want to get stuff done here. There is an entrepreneurial thirst that is just missing in the West. People are hungry to learn, thirsty to create. It's a feeling that **anything** can happen.

My friends back home think I am a bit crazy... ""Oh, why would you want to take the risk of doing business in Africa? Aren't those really shitty countries where only NGOs work?""

That's completely their ignorant loss. 

I love your beautiful continent and people, and ever since I started working here, my opinion has changed greatly. 

I am more bullish here than anywhere else. We're going to see great things coming out of Africa, and it's going to completely take the old players by surprise. Africa is not your Grandpa's Africa anymore.

Nigerian govt to be sanctioned by UK for human rights abuses,70,k1crr5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/k1crr5/nigerian_govt_to_be_sanctioned_by_uk_for_human/,14,1606414452,"  

The UK Parliament has called on the British government to impose international sanctions against the Nigerian government over human rights violations by officials and security agencies against citizens during the EndSARS protests.

The UK Parliament has also demanded the British government to initiate an investigation into the incidents of human rights abuses against Nigerian citizens and how the Muhammadu Buhari government handled the situation during the protests. 

As per reports, these sanctions on the Nigerian government officials will vary from visa bans to freezing of assets. The UK Parliament on Monday debated the petition filed by some groups and individuals seeking sanctions against the Nigerian government over alleged incidents of human rights violations in the country. The petition, accusing the Nigerian government and security officials of extrajudicial killings, was signed by more than 220,000 people from Nigeria and over 2,000 from the UK. 

During the debate, the members of the UK Parliament also slammed Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari over the intimidation and attack on peaceful protesters participating in the #EndSARD demonstrations. The British Parliament also condemned the attack on peaceful and unarmed protesters by the Nigerian military at the Lekki Tollgate.

In addition, parliamentarians have also urged the British government to explore ways to monitor the Nigerian government's development funding in a bid to establish anti-corruption programmes and poverty relief measures. 

Young Nigerians have been protesting police brutality in the country since the early days of October. These protests expanded into broader #EndSARS protests where demonstrators also demanded institutional reforms in government. In between these protests, there have been reports of incidents of police brutality and extra-judicial killings at the hands of Nigerian security officials in Lagos, Rivers, Delta and Oyo among other areas in Nigeria. 

Earlier, a team of UN Human Rights Council called on the Nigerian government to launch an inquiry into protester killings during the protests. In addition, Human Rights Watch also joined the efforts of a number of civil society groups calling for an end in the usage of excessive force against protesters in various parts of Nigeria. 

Amid the ongoing developments, the British Parliament has also asked the UK government to look into the possibility of imposing new sanctions allowing those entities and individuals to be targeted who violate human rights around the world.

To curb this problem, it would be advisable to use flairs next to your usernames so your posts and comments can have a bit of context.  
Dear Diaspora Nigerians, it would also help if you approach these matters with sensitivity and not speak from a position of privilege that is dismissive of the experiences of Nigerians who live in Nigeria. Diaspora Nigerians are encouraged and welcome to contribute here but try to be considerate when offering solutions and criticism to issues you may not have a full grasp of.

FLAIRS YOU CAN USE IF YOU DON'T LIVE IN NIGERIA, DIDN'T GROW UP IN NIGERIA OR NOT A NIGERIAN AT ALL:

* ARAB LEAGUE
* EUROPEAN UNION
* UNITED KINGDOM
* UNITED STATES
* CARIBBEAN ISLANDS
* SOUTH AMERICA
* ASEAN | PACIFIC ISLANDS
* DIASPORA NIGERIAN
* NON-NIGERIAN
* CANADA
* ECOWAS | WEST AFRICA

Again, this will help add context to your opinions and comments. 

You can select your flair by going to **community options on the subreddit's main page. It's on the right-hand side. It gives you the option of picking flairs from Nigeria's states or flairs which are more representative to you if you don't live in Nigeria for example.**  
You can also edit/customize your flair to any fancy stuff you want. e.g some users here have ""ajebo"" as their flairs.  
If you still don't know how to select/edit your flair, [**message the mod team**](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNigeria) with what you want as your flair and we'll do it for you.

**REGARDING POSTS ASKING ABOUT ""WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN NIGERIA?""**

Posts of this nature are no longer allowed since they create a breeding ground for bigotry and give the impression that the lives of the members of the queer community are up for debate. 
This community is a safe space for queer Nigerians and posts which may create a hostile atmosphere for them are not allowed.   
If you can see that it is not okay to ask questions like *""what do you think about igbo people""* or *""what do you think about muslims in Nigeria?""*, then it shouldn't be hard to see why questions asking what people think of the LGBT community are problematic.

I'm the guy who's Black Belt ex-girlfriend attacked him with a frying pan earlier this year. 🍳 (UPDATE),62,j7k1tu,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/j7k1tu/im_the_guy_whos_black_belt_exgirlfriend_attacked/,13,1602215232,"Original Post: https://www.removeddit.com/r/FuckYouKaren/comments/gli84x/my_ex_gf_named_karen_who_is_a_black_belt_in/

First I would like to state that I am an African American male and I was raised by my single mother who after years of abuse, finally decided to leave my pos father. I know that female to male DV is a much less serious issue in our country that male to female. It does however happen. This is my story of using my mother's strength to stand my ground and overcome many things stacked against me in this category of court and community.

After the incident, I made that last Reddit post which hit the front of r/All before several people suggested deleting it due to legal ramifications (they were right btw), I was visited by a local sheriff serving ME a domestic violence restraining order from her. I was very confused seeing as how she was the one arrested for felony assault.

I called the DA in the county the incident took place and they informed me that they decided not to file charges against her, despite the clear witness testimony from her own best friend of 10+ years, as well as the testimony from the neighbor across the street who also witnessed the assault.

She then filed the RO against me for the DV incident (of which she was arrested) under the pretense of ""Online Harassment"" after the fact (again, you guys were right). I had to miss work 3 separate times to travel 3 hours to a different county to fight her RO against me.

Finally in the hearing, the judge determined that she was in fact the aggressor, and denied her RO against me as a few social media posts is not cause enough to file a permanent restraining order against the victim of the assault. Go figure.

Now it was my turn to file the actual restraining order that should have been filed in the first place. We finished court yesterday morning with the judge also stating that he believed her to be the aggressor, and granted the permanent RO against her. I have no restrictions and am now allowed to say whatever I want about the incident.

What blew my mind through all of this was her absolute confidence at every step. That every court, judge, cop, friend, etc. would just automatically believe her and condemn me. She showed up to each hearing walking into the waiting room laughing and joking with whatever friend she decided to show up with. I showed up in a suit and tie out of respect for the court and she literally showed up with a cut-off plaid shirt and capri jeans with converse. At the hearing for her RO against me the judge kicked her friend out of the courtroom for misconduct because he started getting belligerent when the judge denied her RO.

My lawyer will also be pursuing the DA in the original county to re-look at the case and re-consider pressing felony charges. She lied on the stand today claiming under oath that she had no prior history of domestic violence, then my lawyer pulled up a domestic violence charge that she said she ""forgot"" about. Whoops.

I was able to defeat my abuser today and I just wanted to share to give hope to others dealing with people who see themselves as nothing but victims when they are in fact the bullies. I hope that all victims of domestic violence will one day be able to experience this feeling of victory and liberation.",2020-10-09 9:17:12

Take steps to protect your anonimity online, especially when posting hot takes.

Use an encrypted VPN like Mullvad (if not that, remember that as a general rule paid VPNs are better)

An encrypted email like protonmail

Difficult to track browsers like Brave and Tor

Make sure that your username isn't easy to link back to your real name.

This are basic security tips but for what I expect our government to bring up it should be enough.

For Tor, remember that when you use an account on Tor you can't be tracked but what you browse and your account footprint can be recorded if you then open the same account outside of Tor, from there you can be tracked it will allow them to track you and tag your Tor activities back to your IP. So a separate Tor and regular internet accounts are adviced.

But before that, here are some quick facts:
* What has become modern Somaliland was formed in 1884 as a protectorate between us and Britian

* In June 26, 1960 Britain left and we were independent for 5 days, and were known as the state of Somaliland

* July 1st we united with the ex-Italian colony of Somalia and formed the Somali Republic

* October 1969, President is assassinated and a military government is established (similar to other African nations)

* 1977-1978 Dictatorship lost the Ogaden war against Ethiopia, government became increasingly brutal amongst tribal lines

* April 6th, 1981, mainly northern(ex-Somalilanders) form the Somali National Movement, aim was to remove the dictatorship

* 1988-1991 [Isaaq Genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaaq_genocide) occurs as a result of the governments hatred for the Isaaq (ex-Somalilanders, although not all of Somaliland is Isaaq)

* May 18, 1991, Elders and representatives of the former British protectorate come together and sign an agreement and declration of Independence, which was uncrecognised

* 2001 another [referendum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somaliland_constitutional_referendum,_2001) was held by the second president 97% for independence, still rejected by AU and the International community

There are many of us that work hard!

My dad did a DNA test to find his origins and he was majority Nigerian. It said he was mostly identified as part of the Yoruba tribe. I am going to get a test myself and I'm looking forward to it. I've been watching from afar how Nigerians have fought against oppression via the battle to end SARS and I admire your grit and gumption. I supported you all 100% despite not knowing how to help in a real, logistical manner. 

How can I learn more about the homeland that was stripped from me? I've read the wikipedia page on Nigeria but I would like more. :) After the pandemic I plan on taking a trip to Lagos. What can I do to not be an ignorant American while there? I truly want to learn. 

Finally, I am discarding my last name because of its ties to slavery. I emailed the Nigerian embassy for advice on a new middle and last name to take back what was lost and honor the ancestors who lost their identity.

I am not going to act like twitter represent all Nigerians but there is a weird mentality where we have to respect our elders without question (which to be fair can apply to most African countries). And we need to stop this mentality. I'm seeing tweets where they are saying that he should respect his elder which is fucking insane.

I have also seen studies where Nigerians apparently like trump!! Why? What has he done for us? We will always continue to be a fail state if we have a majority of the population who put respect for elders above everything no question asked, tribalism, short-sightedness and willingness to elect ineffective, dumb strongmen in a leadership position.

Four of my friends already knew which means I was terrible at hiding it but they never treated me any differently and we hung out like we always did. Now that I'm starting to look very feminine, I expected them to change and run for the hills but no. They pay me more attention than they did before.

One friend took it hard and we didn't talk for months then  he calls me out of the blue one day inviting me out the next Saturday to play FIFA and since then, it's been so great. He's probably my best friend now. I ran into an old friend from secondary school yesterday and he was so nice to me too.

I thought things would be hard. Much harder than it is but my life is better than it's ever been. I got a really high paying job at an Oil and Energy company and everyone there is great and so nice.

The level of political discussion in this sub is terrible,46,i63hog,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/i63hog/the_level_of_political_discussion_in_this_sub_is/,51,1596938061,"This will probably come across as inflammatory so I want to say in advance: that is not my intention. It's bluntness not aggression.

---------------------------

I've mostly just lurked in this subreddit since I created a Reddit account but recently there's been an uptick in posts about the current state of Nigeria and it's driven me to be more vocal. I'm sorry to say that the level of discussion in most of these posts is frustratingly shallow and circular and if we claim to be serious then we need to re-evaluate because whew.

I'm _not_ sorry to say that I strongly believe that the low quality in these discussions is at least in part due to a big chunk of the active people here being diasporans (there was even a poll demonstrating so yesterday, I think). I am not saying that if you don't live in Nigeria you shouldn't talk here - that's plainly ridiculous. What I am saying is that you can't achieve any real depth or productivity in a conversation if the participants have a shallow connection to/understanding of the matters involved, because the conversation will naturally tend towards the lowest common denominator of knowledge.

For example, there are posts upon posts talking about the problems of the country and invariably the poster will mention corruption in the country. That is true but how many people here can actually discuss in any depth _how_ corruption manifests in Nigeria? How many people posting even know who e.g. Tinubu is (to talk of being able to condemn or defend his godfatherism in Lagos)?

How can we talk about news beyond general platitudes if there's a high chance the person you're talking to barely knows anything about the day-to-day lives of the people it would impact?

I know that everybody here has a connection to Nigeria in some way or another - birth, parents, extended family, etc - even though they might not currently live here, and that's valid. But for the love of all that is holy and all that is not, that doesn't automatically qualify you to be dropping lukewarm takes anyhow. It's honestly getting a little creepy and uncomfortable to read because to be very blunt some of you talk about this country like it's in a comic you read or something. Nigeria is a very real place with a very complex and layered history/politics just like any other country in the world - if you find yourself thinking that there is some simple insight or plan to fix everything that you've come up with in your bedroom, maybe consider that the scope of the problem is beyond your comprehension not that everybody else is just stupid and foolish. 

In conclusion, if we want to keep bringing up the state of the nation then we need to actually be engaged with it. If you want to climb up on a soapbox then do yourself a favour and read about our history, read about contemporary events, and engage with Nigerian social media (this sub barely counts because it's so small). _Talk_ to people that live here (and this also applies to residents tbh, talk to people outside your bubble wherever you live); talk to them about regular everyday things; talk to them about their frustrations; talk to them about community development. If you're serious about change, then all these will be more useful than posting a new version of the same old post and talking in circles in the comments. If that's too much to ask, then please let's leave the hot takes and just talk about suya or banga soup or something. Thanks

P.S. No shade to anyone but sprinkling a lirru pidgin doesn't necessarily make your opinion sound more authentic. A lot of the time it just reads as forced and awkward.

**Editing to pin some recommendations I made in a comment:**

> If you're inclined to read history directly, I consider Toyin Falola's work a must-read (but like most nonfiction they're EXPENSIVE 😭). If you're just looking to dip your toes, I highly recommend The Republic - that magazine has some of the most thoughtful journalism I've ever seen. A subscription is $6 a month but you can read older and some selected current articles for free. For example, you might have heard that the Nigerian government owes pensioners money; [this Republic article](https://republic.com.ng/february-march-2020/nation-forgotten-retirement/) gives a decent overview of the problem as well as personal accounts from some older people who have to live out their retirements without access to their pensions.

> If fiction is more up your alley, I know everyone talks about Chimamanda but when it comes to sharp commentary on Nigeria I can't recommend Elnathan John and Chuma Nwokolo enough.",2020-08-09 7:24:21

Growing up in a Nigerian American household. I was never taught how to use positive coping methods. I’ve seen my brother and father only cry a handful of times. But, they both don’t show too much emotion when it comes to sadness. 

And I know there are other methods in showing sadness but my father has said, “I’m an African man! I don’t cry!”

I cope by allowing myself to feel and react openly. Then I preserve myself mentally from external sources that aren’t healthy to me.

Hi Guys!

I’m relatively new to this sub. I have been a Redditor for 6 years but only stopped lurking about 3 months ago. 
It’s come to my attention that instead of this sub being a place to host civil discussion, it’s become a race to the bottom about who can prove who is right or wrong. That shouldn’t be the atmosphere we should endeavour to create on here. 

It’s well known that it is nearly impossible to persuade or dissuade someone from their opinion, so why bother? 

Sometimes there are grey areas. 
Sometimes truths are relative rather than absolute.
Sometimes our backgrounds or privileges lead to inherent biases we are not immune to, nor aware of.

Let’s try to make this a happy, safe and conducive community for all its members both home and abroad, even including non-Nigerians.

Maybe I’m just being too much of an optimist or hopeless romantic. I’d like to know what you all think.",2020-08-14 21:29:23

My boyfriend (27) was raped by another man and I need advice,38,mrieb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/rape/comments/mrieb1/my_boyfriend_27_was_raped_by_another_man_and_i/,8,1618533145,"A few months ago my boyfriend was raped by another man while very intoxicated. I am a female btw. He met the man at a bar and the man invited him up to his apartment to drink some more (about one block away). My boyfriend is from another state and was visiting for the weekend, so the way he explained it to me was that he made a friend and he thought they were going out more as it was only midnight latest. The man gave my boyfriend a line of coke and my boyfriend said that was when he immediately started acting weird. He walked up behind him in the kitchen and started raping him. My boyfriend said it lasted for less than a few minutes and he ran. The rapist was an African American man who is bigger built. My boyfriend is tall but very, very skinny. He said he froze. My boyfriend is a light weight and gets extremely drunk. 

He didn’t tell me for 4 months. Days following the rape he kept texting me that he loved me multiple times a day so I initially thought he just cheated on me. He actually broke up with me shortly after and I had no idea why. We had been together for 2 years at that point. A few months later he asked to meet up and explained everything to me and told me that he thought breaking up with me would be easier than ever having to admit something like this or even say it out loud. But it wasn’t so he told me everything obviously. He didn’t press charges on the guy he doesn’t even know his name. 

I guess I’m asking for advice because I get in my own head sometimes. I always wonder if it made him question his sexuality or if he’s actually gay and he isn’t telling me the whole story. I always wonder why he went there alone when he was with a few friends. Trust me it makes me feel sick to my stomach that I would actually think that about him but I really can’t help it. I have asked him a few times to please go to therapy but he refuses and says “what is a stranger going to tell me that I don’t already know”. I feel as if I need therapy too because of the thoughts I have about him and his sexuality... it’s also affecting how I see him sexually too which in turn is not helping us. He doesn’t know I feel this way though. I would never want to make this harder for him. I feel as if he got over it but I haven’t. I don’t think about it everyday but when it pops in my head it ruins my day. I feel like because I have these thoughts, I haven’t fully been there for him. I feel like I’m not good enough for him and that he deserves someone who can cope better. 

Aside from that we really get a long great and we are very in love so to me it’s not something worth breaking up over.. I just have nobody to talk to about this or get advice from. I’ve looked on the internet and can’t find much either. 

And please no rude comments. I am genuinely so confused. I feel like a really selfish horrible person often for thinking these things. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much",2021-04-16 6:02:25

But another early cradle of agriculture lay thousands of kilometers away, around West Africa's Niger River Basin, a flurry of plant genomic studies is showing.

Now, a report out this week in Science Advances adds yams to the list of African crops domesticated thousands of years ago in that same area.""

https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-04-28/even-at-10-a-barrel-oil-traders-balk-at-buying-nigeria-s-crude

I just read the above Bloomberg article, which basically says that Nigeria needs to lower the price it's offering for oil - and that makes me so mad.

When the price of oil is high, Western countries can ramp up production and get in on the profits. When prices are low, they can turn off their production and - apparently - allow countries like Nigeria to be the ones to sell at a discount.

I remember also reading about the billion dollar fine that the Nigerian government is being ordered to pay, because a UK company ""lost profits"" after failing to exploit Nigeria's oil.

Economist in the UK and US are arguing over how much money to print in their coronavirus stimulus and how many checks to give their citizens - meanwhile, in Nigeria, (western) economist are saying that the government has no choice but to devalue it's currency. 

I grew up in the UK, thinking that Maggie was some special Nigerian creation (since my Mum uses it so much) but they're made by Nestlé - a massive international conglomerate.

BBC Pidgin is seen a complete joke in the UK. It would be bad enough if it where a Nigerian news company who wrote the articles, but it's the BBC. It's like when I was school, and some of the upper class white teachers would try to 'relate' to me by speaking slang. Very cringe.

I think that the biggest problem in Nigeria is a lack of young men who are like white men from the enlightenment era. Rational, free thinking, and in love with learning. But also brave and defiant. Men who want to know about the world so that they can control and predict it. Not just to pass a test.",2020-05-01 1:24:45
Is Podcasting worth it in 2021,35,lraflb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/lraflb/is_podcasting_worth_it_in_2021/,15,1614194204,"People still don’t know what a podcast is and where to find one.

Put simply, a podcast is a series of audio recordings, a window into someone's thoughts. A blog essentially, but in audio format.

A weekly release for new episodes is common, but there are daily podcasts, weekly podcasts, and really whenever the creator decides.

Podcasting is an excellent way for an individual to get their message out there and build a community of people with similar interests.

These episodes are audio files that are usually stored with a podcast hosting company; Anchor, Libsyn, and others. They make it easy for anyone to start.

As a teacher, this is one way to connect with more students, as an entrepreneur, this is one way to share your values with the public.

Podcasts are great for repurposing content. If you already have audio or video classes, you can quickly and easily turn them into podcast episodes. Similarly, you can turn podcasts into written content, distributing the same information in multiple ways across several channels.

Providing a transcript or reference notes alongside the audio helps with search engine optimization.
Use these notes to encourage mailing list signups, and then turn them into weekly or monthly blog posts and/or newsletters.

Think about different audiences and how you can rework your content to appeal to both the listeners working out at the gym or those relaxing at home.

Longer episodes can be re-cut and republished as quick sound bites to reach audiences with shorter attention spans, which can draw them into listening to a full episode.

It is already possible for creators to slowly begin to monetize their podcasts, the data looks promising.
Last year alone advertisers spent over 700 million dollars on podcast ads and are projected to spend over a billion dollars this year.

The Nigerian podcasting space may be relatively small, but it is certainly showing signs of promise and growth.
It will be interesting to see how podcasting unfolds in Nigeria over the coming years.

Now is the time to start your own podcast.",2021-02-25 0:46:44

"ON ORLU, ESN AND NIGERIA'S MILITARY",35,ln1k3v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/ln1k3v/on_orlu_esn_and_nigerias_military/,41,1613722491,"Yesterday, February 18, 2021, Nigeria's Military in search of the training grounds and personnels of Eastern Security Network (ESN) unleashed lethal airstrikes on #Orlu, Imo State, a civilian settlement that's relatively peaceful. The casualty levels of this barbaric act is still yet to be ascertained. 

Few weeks ago, January 22, 2021 to be precise, soldiers were deployed on the street of the same city and sporadic gunshots with live ammunition were released on innocent civilians, killing over 5 people going about their legitimate businesses at different spots. Shops, houses and even a church were burnt down in the name of rooting out ESN.

While I cannot question the resolve of the armed forces to rid the country of non-state armed actors, I find it very disturbing to know that the Nigerian Armed Forces, a professional and national military outfit, will resort to such extreme measures at addressing issues of this nature, especially one involving peaceful civilians in a built-up area.

What happened to the use of intels in engaging civilian populations and skirmishes?

This is very troubling, completely irreconcilable and totally unacceptable!

This is another arbitrary, excessive and misapplicable use of the military by the Buhari government and is capable of heating the polity that is already suffering from ethnic and sectarian tensions on many fronts.

Nigeria cannot afford another insurgency at this time of our national life and government should not give restive elements an excuse to do so.

Every well meaning Nigerian must call the president and the military to exercise restraint in addressing the issues in the South East. 

While we continue to preach the message of peace to all groups in our dear country, government have a responsibility to carry out its functions and duties in a responsible and professional manner. 

No sane person burns down their house in the name of fumigation!

No responsible government can hate its citizens!

On the Psychological Effects of Flogging/Beating the Child and the Potential Damage in Relationship between the Parent and the Child (In Nigeria),33,g9v273,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/g9v273/on_the_psychological_effects_of_floggingbeating/,8,1588135001,"I've observed the way parents flog their children and I think it does more damage than good when you consider the overall psyche of the said child and the relationship that he/she has with their parents.

An average 5-year-old in a first world country is likely to be bold and assertive. They aren’t camera-shy, they know their rights and they speak up and question the things and people around them. Average 5-year-old Nigerians that are exposed to constant corporal/domestic punishment are likely to be timid, shy and are afraid to express themselves.

They feel stifled are discouraged to explore the world because they will always feel like they don't have the permission to do so. A lack of exploration of the world/environment will eventually stunt intellectual growth and won’t give us the essential idea of reality that corresponds with our ages.

In life, we need to know that we as human beings deserve to be happy and so we deserve to take action on the things that give us fulfillment or happiness without the permission of those above us.

Cracking the whip cracks the spirit and makes one scared to challenge authority. This is why the Nigerian youth today fear standing up to the government that oppresses them, because they have been mentally conditioned to always stand down to anything or anyone stronger than them. The cane has put us down and we have learned to respect it whether it is right or wrong. An environment like this is bound to stifle creativity, self-expression and happiness.

I’ve never really understood parents who hit their children while teaching them homework. It makes absolutely no sense. If a human being doesn't understand a concept, yelling or hitting them won't make them get it. You have to be patient, adjust your teaching style and try to be more articulate. If someone doesn’t understand something you’re explaining, the problem is most likely with you and not them. Children require patience. A lot of it. And if it is something you don’t have, no one is putting a gun to your head to bear them (children).

A lot of Nigerian parents are not patient with their children and don't take the time to hear them out. Almost every disagreement is inclined toward violence and in the long run this is bound to poison the sacred and archetypal relationship between a parent and their child.

If this persists, the child may breed a latent dislike for their parents that may not manifest until they are outside their control. The manifestation of this dislike will most likely be unconscious, unexpected and likely to occur when the child is much older.

There will always be exceptions. ""Some children are stubborn and won't change except they are flogged."" I know that and I am not talking about the exceptions here.

Yes, you could spank children once in a while. Of course, they need discipline. But if your first response to every disapproval is to pull out a cane or give a backhand slap, then there is a huge problem and this should be addressed. This is the norm in many Nigerian homes.  

There are people that will brag about their tough childhoods as if they wouldn't have been better off having healthy relationships with their parents. They are proud to show their marks and scars, saying, “If not for how I was treated, I won’t be where I am today”. As if it is intrinsically a good thing. Suffering that has no utility. Unnecessary suffering.

“Shuffering and Shmiling” as Fela put it aptly, has been the default for many Nigerians for many years and maybe it’s time for a different perspective. It's time to emancipate ourselves from the victim/slave mentality. It is not noble to embrace suffering with no utility.

Let’s try to be as diplomatic and as patient as possible when dealing with little humans and maybe they will reciprocate the gesture when we are older and the tables are turned.

The decision to bear children is one that comes with many complexities and responsibilities. We must choose to unravel these complexities with all of the patience, love, kindness and humility that we can muster.

Here's the last time I'm going to ask about it, because other users have given me a lot to think about. Thank you in advance for your time and advice, and TL:DR at the bottom. (We're all in the US, by the way.) -----

My mom prays a lot. Loves to pray. That's nothing abnormal in a Christian household, especially for some Nigerian families. But I fear she's taking things a bit extreme, and I'm unsure how to help her or if she even needs help. 

She lives alone, as I and my younger sister are in college (24 & 21 respectively, Sis is in-state, I'm 200+ miles away in grad school). But she doesn't seem to be dealing with her empty home very well. 

She stays up all night to pray, sleeps with the lights on and on the floor and sets multiple alarms to wake herself up easier. She has handwritten posters around her room telling her not to sleep, and wrote ""Jesus"" in Sharpie on all of the doors and windows of the house.

This doesn't seem so bad (or does it? I'm not sure.) But she's letting things go in the house. Lightbulbs are burnt out and not replaced. Bills are being paid late. She's lost her car keys for months. She herself only eats 5-6 things and doesn't sleep more than 4-5 hours a night, taking naps often during the day and trying to pray away any residual sleepiness. 

I understand, most people don't really like to talk about their personal life, but she has no other outlet besides me or my sister. She doesn't talk to anyone outside of us unless it's to convert them or discuss the glory of God with them in detail, and I can't always be there to listen. I feel terrible. She's not close to her family back home because they didn't treat her well and always need something from her. And she doesn't really talk to family here. 

She lost her job six years ago as an ER doctor due to an organ transplant, and she hasn't quite gotten back into practicing medicine since. I don't know if she wants to quit and possibly go into seminary instead, which would be perfectly fine and something she'd love. But she doesn't like to see anyone except my sister or myself, and I'm not sure how to support her so far away. 

Sometimes I wonder if I should quit my program and move back in to help her, be there for her. But if she needs attention and someone to talk to, will I ever be able to leave? 

I admittedly wanted to get an apartment of my own once I'm done with school. But this seems unheard of. I feel even more selfish thinking about that, so I'm not sure how to react or what to do. Any and all advice would be really appreciated. 

TL;DR: My single mom is very private, but she seems to be going through a lot and I'm unsure how to help her and support her while outside of the house. Should I go back home and quit grad school?",2019-09-12 5:01:59

It’s official! After much dragging of feet, earlier this week, Nigeria officially became a member of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). 

**What’s this about?**

Some 8 years ago, during the 2012 African Union session at Ethiopia, Heads of States agreed to create a single continental market for goods and services, with free movement of workers and investment. 

You see, the AfCFTA is one out of many moves to make the African Union like the European Union -- same policies, same currencies, greater security and more opportunities for businesses and markets, which lead to improved economic stability and growth. You get the gist?

**But all that glitters isn’t gold**

The motive towards creating the AfCFTA although great is not without its possible drawbacks.

**Lower Tariffs:** A major incentive is that the trade tariffs paid between African countries would reduce. African businesses, traders and consumers will no longer pay tariffs on about 90% of goods that they trade between African countries. However, some countries that receive more tariffs than they pay would be disadvantaged. The World Bank has [estimated ](http://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/341821468201836948/pdf/797120BRI0PN390Box0377384B00PUBLIC0.pdf)that over 80% of all goods entering the Port of Cotonou (Benin) are destined for final delivery outside of Benin. Niger and Nigeria account for about 90 per cent of Cotonou's transit/re-export traffic.

**Increased Competition:** Opening up borders and economy to other countries leads to a battle between sectors. There’s been an influx of goods from other countries. For example, Nigeria’s Manufacturing sector now competes with that of 54 other countries, this explains why there was a lot of pushback from Nigeria’s Manufacturing sector.

**Jobs:  As per** [**Stears Business**](https://www.stearsng.com/premium/article/will-the-afcfta-be-worth-it-for-nigeria)**,** African employment is expected to see some significant shifts: by 2035, there will be almost 2 million fewer workers in processed food and other business services (accounting, legal, real estate), and 3.5 million more workers in energy-intensive manufacturing. The freer flow of goods, services, and workers would mean that jobs would be lost, while more would be created in certain sectors.

**The elephant in the room: Closed borders**

For over a year,  Nigeria’s land borders with Benin, Niger, and Cameroon have been closed, a part of the government’s plan to stop the smuggling of food items which it says undermines local agricultural businesses. Joining the AfCFTA would mean that the Nigerian government can’t just wake one morning and do what it likes.

**Broken Promises:** African countries are known to not keep trade agreements, even ECOWAS countries do not allow trade between each other. For Example, Cement manufacturers in Nigeria [can not and are not allowed](https://cloout.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=86c8a47169e6f16060876c3a9&id=8a83bbb020&e=dbbbf2064c) to sell cement in Benin Republic, even though Nigeria and Benin Republic are both members of  [Ecowas Trade Liberalisation Scheme (ETLS)](https://cloout.us20.list-manage.com/track/click?u=86c8a47169e6f16060876c3a9&id=48cecc4780&e=dbbbf2064c) \- a scheme that should allow the free movement of goods without tariffs between ECOWAS members.

**Looking forward:** In a world where everything works as planned, the AfCFTA would only deliver positives, but that world doesn’t exist yet.

New strategies for #EndSARS and strategy on how we negotiate with the government,30,jh7805,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/jh7805/new_strategies_for_endsars_and_strategy_on_how_we/,15,1603566888,"A STATEMENT FROM THE COALITION OF PROTEST GROUPS ACROSS LAGOS AND NIGERIA

Following the nationwide address from President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday, October 22, we are more resolved to press not just for justice but for a new and better Nigeria where all citizens are safe and can thrive.

Lagos State, where the hotbed of resistance began has been under state-wide curfew imposed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Prior to that, Soldiers attacked peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate and unleashed carnage. We have watched with horror, the ensuing acts of violence, murder, looting, razing and vandalization of homes, businesses and organizations in Lagos State, and we will like to state emphatically that these are not protesters. We completely condemn any form of violence or looting.

For the sake of the wellbeing of our comrades and ordinary citizens being adversely affected by this, we will deprioritize the physical protests, for now. But, for the sake of those who died, before the protests, during the protests, and at the hands of Soldiers at the Lekki Toll Gate — people who the government has largely refused to acknowledge, THE STRUGGLE MUST CONTINUE.

Here are our objectives in the next few days:

1. Clean Up
During our protests, we made a conscious effort to clean up the venues and keep our environment safe for everyone. Following the condemnable vandalizations that took place since the curfews began, we are volunteering efforts towards the clean-up and rebuilding of the state.

2. Online Protest
We will continue to intensify online publicity and protest of the issues and demands made. We will be hosting conversations, sharing articles and amplifying voices of thought leaders in that direction.

3. Offline Community Engagement
We will continue grassroot mobilization and civic education of the masses, providing tools for education to enable them to understand the scale and scope of what is at stake.

4. Timelines
We are putting a timeline together to track actions taken to meet our demands. This way, we know what has been done, what is being done, and what can be ticked off our list. This way, we know if and when the government defaults, and we can decide if a return to the streets is necessary.

5. Strategy:
We are building short, medium- and long-term strategies to sustain this momentum and keep this fire that has been ignited by the actions of young people across Nigeria burning. The strategies are pillared on and geared towards Education, Voter Registration, Political Consciousness and Representation for Young People in government.

6. Structure:
We will create a structure to strategically consolidate demands, formalize the coalition, galvanize the continued online protest, develop standards for monitoring and evaluation, and continue the mobilization and education of the citizens.

7. Representation:
The leaderless nature of this protest but consistent oneness in demands have been part of our unique strengths. As we move towards consolidation and negotiation, it is now pertinent we put forward a diverse group to represent the different coalitions; from celebrities to activists, legal minds to strategists, journalists to entrepreneurs, etc. We consulted far and wide, to come up with these names, and while this may not be exhaustive, it offers us an interim basis to begin the negotiation and consolidation.

The nominees will meet with different protest leaders/blocs across the country/states, and consolidate on a vehicle for continuous demands. They will also track actions of the Government, represent our demands and provide feedback to us regularly.

They are:

Names of Nominees at the State level: (Lagos)
Click to Vote: https://forms.gle/btKtvJitkJNKq7eK8

Advisory:
Due to the decentralized nature of this movement across the country, we nominate a team with experience in leadership and diplomacy, to assist in advisory and other support. This team will be consulted from time to time within the process. The criteria are people with integrity, people who have a vast experience in national issues, and who have a track record of being pro-young people.

Nominees for Advisory Board
Click to Vote: https://forms.gle/kJbAm7Ukp2j9ATMZ7

All nominations are provisional. If there are people you think should be on the list, people who have been critical in the success of these protests and can work towards the actualization of our demands, and the ultimate mission — a better government/future for Nigeria, please nominate.

In conclusion, these protests have never been politically motivated. It is not about ethnicity or tribalism. The young people across the country are demanding justice, good governance, accountability and reforms. These protests have no sponsor nor agenda other than what we have stated repeatedly; better governance, accountability and an end to brutality.

To everyone who has lost someone or something, we stand in solidarity with you.
To all our heroes that died before and during these struggles, we say Rest in Power! Your deaths will not be in vain.
It is NOT finished!
On behalf of the Coalition.

I understand some of us aren't exactly excited by this  and haven't been in a long time, I think it is very important to reflect and put things into perspective.

If you look at the histories of the countries you admire, you will observe that within their 60 years of independence, they were still struggling with a lot of turmoil and inadequacies.

America was in numerous wars in 60 years and a lot of political infighting which culminated in the civil war almost 100 years after their independence - a war that still has an aftermath felt till today

Countries like the entire EU (and UK, thanks Brexit), China, Japan etc have seen and continue to see so much turmoil in their ancient and modern histories including the devastation of 2 world wars.

For a country that was designed to either be under the control of a detached  monarch  miles away or simply fail, we still de strong gidigba. 

We are an independent country able to determine our own destiny.

Our stability is our strength. 

With only slightly more than 20 years of civilian democratically constituted government, we still have a long way to go but the most important thing is to keep going.

At 60, as a Nigerian, think about our current state and how to make your community ergo your country a better place. Reflect on ways we can develop or invest in our communities with our resources of either time, money or both.

Beware Of New Accounts Pushing Tribalism And Spreading Lies,30,jg1awx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/jg1awx/beware_of_new_accounts_pushing_tribalism_and/,2,1603407858,"By now you should have noticed an up well in accounts claiming everything from the Lekki Massacre being a fake video to Insecurity news in the North being entirely manufactured by bad actors.

They are everywhere, from Reddit to Nairaland, from Facebook to Twitter.

This is to warm the Nigerian people and especially Nigerian youths that they are individuals paid off by the Nigerian government under ""operation crocodile smile"" to spam falsehoods all across the internet, denying truths that we see with our eyes like Lekki and pushing pro government Propaganda.

This tactic is very similar to what has been called by Westerners ""50 cent army"" in relation to China, using paid accounts to spread Propaganda and lies useful to their government.

This isn't the first time that Nigeria has done this, in Nairaland some have called the the ""200 Laptops"", but this time they are in full force. They are typically new accounts and all their posts are anti-protesters, anti-change, pro-military and pro-government

And it isn't limited to spreading disinformation but also promoting Tribalism. Everything in Nigeria works with divide and conquer tactics in mind, from our armed forces to Bureaucracy and this protests have shown a level of unity never seen.

So they are also trying to use tribal grievances to break up the protests. Don't let them win, Youths of Nigeria, remain united. And they often pretend to be of another tribe to spread the division better so don't trust names that sound like from your tribe when they are spreading division.

Forgive the Youths of today for the Sins of their Fathers and remember that you have the same enemy, the Nigerian government and most importantly be wise, shrew and thriftful. Don't let their tactics succeed but still ensure that you purge the actual bad elements from their personal behaviour because that is another tactic that they use, to fill peaceful movements with saboteurs..",2020-10-23 4:34:18

Serious Covid-19 Question for Nigerians in Nigeria,26,fjtdsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/fjtdsr/serious_covid19_question_for_nigerians_in_nigeria/,61,1584425027,"Ok, folks.  I'm an ex-pat here in Lagos.  I think I made a big mistake when I got on a plane last week and came back here for work.

People from socioeconomic and educational levels ranging from the driver who dropped out of high school to play football and broke his knee, to technical professionals with advanced university degrees seem to think that this latest global pandemic won't make it to Nigeria.  Why?

""It's too hot and humid for the Coronavirus.""

Um, Singapore anybody? Malaysia?  Brunei?

""Nigerians have strong immune systems.""

Yes there are genetic features that confer a degree of resistance to malaria, and you are all certainly used to a different bacterial flora than visitors are, but *really*?

""A bunch of people in Africa got Ebola but Nigerians did a real good job of keeping it out. It will be the same as Covid-19.""

Yeah, patient zero landed in Lagos with a fever and collapsed immediately.  No need for fancy tests.Covid-19 has no symptoms for up to 14 days.

I'll go back to the driver.  He picks me up at a hotel where they check my temperature, the security folks are wearing gloves and masks, and they make you use sanitizer when you pass through the x-ray machine. I was telling him how impressed I am with the way they seem to be handling things.  He starts to tell me a story about his friend who died in December.  When they found her it ""seemed like she was strangled but without any marks.""

I was like, ""Dude.  That's Covid-19.  Sometimes people can't breathe and they die without a respirator. Are you telling me you think she had this virus?""  He starts laughing and telling me that Nigerians can't catch this virus and, instead, she came to him in a dream and told him her mother killed her with juju. This is a true story, folks.  The guy isn't worried about germs but thinks juju kills people.

For a country such as Italy, in 3 weeks they went from business as usual to 28,000 cases and over 2100 fatalities.  *3 weeks.*  I go into work and about half of the people take the handwashing and sanitizer regime seriously.  Some people are not shaking hands, while others seem to have their feeling hurt or are confused when their handshake is rejected, somehow clueless that there is a global pandemic going on.

So, to get to my question.  How many of you are genuinely worried?  How many of you subscribe to the opinions I've highlighted above? Perhaps some of you can share another reason why Nigeria will somehow avoid the fate that most of the world has not.

Elves and Fairies in West African Folklore,24,nnv9p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Africa/comments/nnv9p8/elves_and_fairies_in_west_african_folklore/,12,1622347644,"Most of us are familiar with elves, dwarfs, sidhe, satyrs, nymphs and the Tuatha de Danann- but what of their equivalents from the African continent? Here are a few of the “good folk” that wander the grasslands and forests of West Africa:

1. **The Aziza/Azizan:**

According to Carol Rose’s scholarly **“An Encyclopedia of Sprits, Fairies and Leprechauns”**, the Aziza are the “little people” of those communities which formerly made up the Dahomey Kingdom in West Africa (whose borders existed within the modern nation of Benin). They inhabit the deep forests and had a relationship with the hunters who ventured into them. The Aiziza have conferred some of their knowledge of supernatural powers onto these hunters, who in turn have since introduced this knowledge to human society. For this, the Aziza were propitiated. 

The **“Encyclopedia of Fairies in World Folklore and Mythology”** by Theresa Bane gives similar information, but adds: “Considered to bring luck with them, the Aziza were often called upon by the native people for assistance in hunting and luck in general.” 

The book **“African Myths of Origin”** by Stephen Belcher records a story from the Fon (the dominant ethnic group of the Dahomey Kingdom), wherein a hunter whose wife suffered from leprosy came across a mound of earth inhabited by an azizan. The azizan spoke to the hunter, who never saw it with his own eyes, and presented him with a remedy composed of plants from the forest. The azizan offered to provide more remedies if the hunter returned with descriptions of the ailments that afflicted his people. The hunter returned on multiple occasions and the azizan kept his word. Eventually, the king of the country himself visited the mound and, after making various offerings, told the azizan “that in his land they had no means of curing sicknesses, and asked the azizan to provide him with remedies.” The azizan “gave the king of the country many of the Vodun \[gods\] who are now worshipped there \[...\] and the king took them back.”

The gods referred to here are the deities of the Fon religion, or Vodun. Fon religion and folklore survived in the New World in the form of Voodoo. 

2) **The Mmoatia:**

According to Carol Rose, this is the title given to a group of Little People in West African folklore. The Ashanti believe that they are the “guardian spirits” of the wilderness and of the animals that live there. 

**“The Annotated African-American Folktales”** by Maria Tartar and Henry Louis Gates Jr. records a number of Black American folktales as well as their African analogues. The collection has a West African tale titled: “How the Sky God’s Stories Came to be Known as Spider Stories.”

In this tale, Anansi the Spider (a trickster hero) asks the Sky God Nyankapon for the price of his stories. The Sky God replied that “They cannot be brought for anything except Onini the Python, Osebo the Leopard, Mmoatia the Fairy and Mmboboro the Hornets.” Anansi then agrees to capture all of these things and bring them back to the Sky God.

Anansi tricked the Mmoatia by creating a doll with yams in her hand and plastered with tree sap. When one of the Mmoatia spotted the doll, she was fooled into thinking it was a real child, and asked it for some yams. Anansi through his trickery made the doll appear to reply by nodding its head. After bringing along one of her sisters, they ate the yams, but when they thanked the doll there was no reply. Enraged, one of the sisters slapped the doll and her hand became stuck the sap. Her sister prompted her to strike it with her other hand and then to push it with her stomach, but the other fairy only became more stuck. Anansi then revealed himself and took the fairy, along with a captured python, leopard and hornet’s nest, to the Sky God, whereupon Anansi received the great deity’s stories. 

3) **The Ijimere**

The Yoruba (an ethnic group primarily found in Nigeria) are known for their profound impact on the cultures of the Black Diaspora and for the vitality and longevity of their traditional beliefs. A sizeable portion of the Yoruba still practice their ancestral traditions in West Africa, and their religious influence includes New World manifestations of their faith such as Santeria and Candomble. 

According to Rose’s encyclopedia, Ijimere is “the collective name for a group of spirits in the West African Folklore of the Yoruba People.” These “little people” inhabit the depths of the forests and the wild places in the country of Nigeria.

Nigeria needs to come up from under the UK and USA. Especially when it comes to Banking.,24,e8hx18,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nigeria/comments/e8hx18/nigeria_needs_to_come_up_from_under_the_uk_and/,28,1575962635,"I'm a UK/Nigerian citizen interested in going into some kind of professional service. When people talk about a lack of jobs in Nigeria, I think these are the kind of jobs they mean. Cushy corporate jobs and high flying finance roles.

I'm a part of a charity which is supposed to help graduates from poorer backgrounds find top graduate roles. Through them, I've been exposed to corporate side of the western world, and there are a few things which really bother me.

The first is how it's near impossible to find out what these people do unless you're already one of them. You can spend 3 years studying accounting at university, and still graduate with basically zero knowledge of what an accountant does day to day. Plus, things change constantly and quickly - Microsoft Office did not exist 20 years ago, but now it's basically impossible to do modern accounting without an internet connection and a computer.

The second is how much networking can effect how far you go in these industries, even though they are suppose to be meritocracies. You can do so much work, you can try to actually understand and figure out what these guys do, and you try to become the best at it - but in the end if you don't get past the interview stage you'll never be able to prove yourself. At the interview stage, you're competing with possibly dozens of others who want a chance to prove themselves just as much as you, so you better have some way to stand-out - otherwise good-luck playing the CV lottery.

And the final thing is that, once you end up in a nice safe corporate job, why would you admit to others that you aren't as valuable as people think? If you've spent years struggling and fighting to get to the top, why would you admit that it's all a scam once you've reached the top? This might sound very conspiratorial, but when you consider the the last two points I made I don't think it's that much of a stretch. I've met many consultants who joke about being useless - but what do you expect them to do - ask to be fired?

That said, many consultants and bankers actually do leave the industry to start charities - in fact, that's how the charity I'm a part of was started (although the banker who started the charity I'm in has no issues with the industry beyond inequality). But what does this have to do with Nigeria? Well, 2 main things.

The first it that the western education system is more or less designed to produce people who can go into the professional services industry. School uniforms and timed classes are basically training wheels for suits and scheduled meetings. But if you don't have a professional services industry, then a western-style education is a pointless waste of time. I often hear about graduates who can't find well-paying jobs in Nigeria, and I think this is part of why that is so common.

Which bring me to the second thing - Nigeria does not need a professional services industry. At least, not one like the UKs or the USAs. I think these industries are newer than people realize - so it seems like trying to aiming to be a lawyer, or a banker, or a consultant is just what people have always aimed for. It seems almost obvious that being a banker would be better than being a farmer. But I disagree - and not just in a 'Dangote is basically a farmer' sort of way. I think even smallholder farmers deep in the villages deserve as much respect, clout, and \*credit\* as most people in professional services.

But if I were to go a bank, and I were to ask for a loan so that I could fund a construction project where I provide electricity to and houses for a farming-focused village in Africa, I would be laughed out of the room. I would be told things like 'How will they pay you back?' On the flip-side, if I were to start a company centered around that village, I'd never be able pay my farmers as much as bankers make, because no bank would support a company that with that kind of goal. Across the sea, in the UK and the USA, banks are happy to be able loan money to government to fund public projects like this - and the government will always have enough money to pay for things since they can just loan/print even more money. Companies like WeWork and Uber can pay their employees and software engineers as much as they like, and they can lose as much money as they want, but banks and investors will still loan them money because somehow that's a safer bet than betting on a village in Africa.",2019-12-10 12:53:55

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

First off, my deepest condolences to those affected by the building collapse on Lagos Island.    I felt terrible reading the news about it this weekend.

&#x200B;

Thanks again for all of your great advice for my short visit to Lagos.  I am usually shy to pull out my camera and almost never take photos of people in the street, so as not to be rude.   Nevertheless, as promised, I did take some photos to share, which are in this album on Imgur: [https://imgur.com/a/vUyfveL](https://imgur.com/a/vUyfveL)

&#x200B;

A couple of reflections and some advice for any future solo travelers to Lagos:

&#x200B;

1. **Arrival via airport and getting around**: You can catch an Uber at the airport quite easily, though due to the construction you have to walk a bit of a ways from the terminal to get to the temporary car loop.  Getting around town was easy, safe and relatively cheap via Uber, so I only took a few taxis and never an okada or public transit.
2. **SIM cards**: It was easy to get an Airtel SIM card at the international arrivals terminal in the airport, using my hotel as an address and my passport as ID.  My flight arrived quite late (10PM) and the booth was still open.  However, I had to re-register my SIM card twice for some reason -- I understand this has been a common problem on many networks.
3. **Inter-city transit:**  I took the ABC Transport bus from Lekki terminal (5:00 AM departure) to Cotonou, Republic of Bénin.  Very professional service and a nice clean bus.  My only complaint is that they *really* blast the air conditioning -- the bus was 16°C for the whole trip.  If your AC is making the Canadian shiver, then maybe it's a bit much? :)
4. **Where to stay on a budget**:  I stayed at Peerage Retreat and Resort on Lagos Island, off Ajose. This is the place recommended by the Lonely Planet travel guide. The shower didn't work very well and there were a few cockroaches in the bathroom, but the sheets were clean, the staff were wonderful, the air conditioner and WiFi worked, and the location was great.  I would probably stay there again but would request a different room with a better shower.
5. **Best view of the city**:  Of course, Lagos is so huge that you can't really see the whole thing from one place.  However, the rooftop patio at the Eko Hotel has great views.  There are probably some other buildings in the city with great views, but I didn't have time to ask whether I could visit their top floors.
6. **Food**:  Nigerian food is really good but it was a bit tough to find good restaurants at a decent price in Lagos.  There were a lot of very expensive (often empty) restaurants, as well as a lot of (sometimes questionable) street food sold from a Thermos.  The challenge was to find a cheap meals cooked fresh to order, because my belly wasn't quite ready to eat street food from a Thermos.  Nevertheless, I definitely ate lots of suya, jollof rice and okra soup, which were all very awesome.
7. **Security**:  I felt perfectly safe walking alone during the day on Lagos Island, Victoria Island, and in Ikeja on the mainland.  But I would be reluctant to walk alone at night if I wasn't with a local who knew the area well.
8. **Highlights**:
   1. **Nike Art Gallery** is absolutely amazing.  Easily one of my favourite art galleries anywhere in the world.  A must-see for anyone visiting Lagos from overseas.
   2. **Lekki Conservation Area** is also fantastic. Great canopy walk, cute monkeys, and generally a welcome break from the dusty, noisy city.  Another must-see.
   3. The rooftop patio at the **Eko Hotel** has a great view of Victoria Island.  But I only stayed for one beer because it's ridiculously expensive.
   4. At the **New Afrika Shine,** I had a fun afternoon playing pool with some friendly young people who didn't speak much English. The staff were really friendly and gave me a warm welcome.  I should have stayed for the concert, but after a couple of hours I was slightly stoned and decided to get back to VI before dark. Monday night was just a DJ set anyway.  In hindsight, I really should have gone for the big show on Sunday night.
   5. Ditto for **Freedom Park**: it was a nice place to chill during the day, but I really should have gone to a concert at night.
   6. The **National Museum** has some really neat stuff and a lot of potential, but it badly needs a renovation.
   7. **Terra Kulture** was a nice small art gallery and a tasty (albeit expensive) restaurant.
   8. I could not find the **Oba of Lagos palace** \-- it has two different locations on Google Maps and I ended up getting stuck in traffic in the market there.  The traffic jam was entertaining enough though.
   9. For **nightlife**, my friend took me out one night a few spots on Victoria Island, but I have no idea what the places were called.  Great suya though!  When I was on my own I mostly drank at Pat's Bar on Ajose since it was walking distance from my hotel.  The live music was fantastic but the gold-digging/prostitution was a bit annoying.  Made me feel a bit embarrassed to be a white man.
9. **General observations (positive and negative)**
   1. Lagos has a lot cool stuff, especially its cultural scene (art, food, music, film, fashion, etc.).  But it's challenging as an outsider to actually find all of that cool stuff, and many Nigerians seem to only talk about the bad things.  With a bit of effort and a lot more self-confidence, Lagos could be a major tourist destination.  But you need to believe that statement if you want to make it happen.
   2. People on the street in Lagos were generally very polite, and frankly a bit shy compared to neighbouring countries.  I do not understand why many Ghanaians told me that Nigerians are ""aggressive"".  I felt the complete opposite -- people mostly kept to themselves.  Maybe they are confusing you with Nigeri**e**ns, who do seem to have a lot of spunk in them.
   3. A giant high five to anyone who participated in the marathon last month.  It was so hot out that I would be exhausted from walking around -- you are all superheroes for running a marathon in that heat!
   4. Thank you for all of the signs reminding me not to urinate on things.
   5. Hat tip to the guy who was selling coat racks in the traffic jam.  I'm not sure that it would even fit in the vehicle, but I very much appreciated the option of buying a coat rack through my car window.
   6. Why are there so many abandoned petrol stations from the 1980s on the highway toward the border?  They actually look pretty cool -- a photo series would make a great coffee table book.
   7. I don't understand why they cut down all of the trees and walled off waterfront throughout the city.  Maybe it's just a bad first impression, but Lagos would really benefit from some more urban trees and public spaces.

Anyway, I only stayed for five days because my total trip took my 1,200 km to Abidjan.  But I did really enjoy my stay!  Thanks again to /r/nigeria for your friendly advice and I look forward to visiting again soon.  A lot of folks told me that Abuja and Calabar are really nice cities, so I hope to see them some day.

My story of leaving an abusive relationship with a narcissistic psycopath,23,8m8u9q,https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/8m8u9q/my_story_of_leaving_an_abusive_relationship_with/,2,1527352337,"At first I posted this on r/relationships, but they removed it because of my mentioning domestic abuse, so I would like to share my story with you and hopefully inspire someone to stand up for themselves and leave.

My first post was this one: 
""We've been together for 3 years, married 1 year. We are both immigrants in a European country, I'm from another EU member state and he is from another continent. I'm staying here only for him, other than that I would have a better life with my family and friends in my homeland. Things were amazing between us at first. I explained away every red flag, like excessive possessiveness, jealousy, him using my money for himself as I desperately tried to save it. As I worked full time he stopped working at one point and started drinking and smoking pot full time. He took control of our spending and dictated what should be paid and what not. Before I realized how deep it went he destroyed my financial credibility, allowing unpaid bills to get in the hands of debt collectors. Basically I cannot rent an apartment or get anything that's not paid for at once. Debt collectors have already blocked over 500 eur on my account and my salary is not enough to pay it off and pay rent and groceries by myself. He promised me he's changed, he's been working since March and was supposed to pay everything off. I was waiting for this moment to come, but yesterday he brutally assaulted me. Before that assault he would sometimes yell at me and even breaking things, it escalated to holding my hands in order to restrict my movement and finally pushing. Yesterday he kicked, slapped and sit on me not allowing me to escape. We have only one phone (mine, he broke his a long ago but keeps using mine every day), so I tried to get my hands on it to call ambulance, but he kept saying I don't need it, I just have to sleep it off. Today he took the phone with him so I couldn't call in sick at work and go to the hospital/the police. I had a shift till midnight and I'm back in the apartment, he's sleeping but I'm scared to death.

I have a part time job and thesis to write in my post-graduate studies here. I cannot afford kicking him out with police help from this apartment because of the rent and my account being blocked. It takes time to search for something else, like a room. Also, if I go I'm taking every electronic device with me (all his devices are somehow damaged), so he won't be able to even get up to work if he doesn't buy at least a phone. We won't be happy at all, I'm afraid he won't let me leave. I want to go back home to my parents and get a job in my country, but I have to take care of every contract I have here before I do that and I'm worried about those debts. What should I do?""

4 weeks later I wrote an update (my current situation): 
First of all I want to thank all for your kind words. My post wasn't popular but I wanted to write an update to give hope and inspire other women in similar situations.

The very next day I got up early, when he was asleep. I took my phone and bag and went straight to the police. It was Sunday morning, two days after he beat me. I had some visible bruises and cuts on my face and hands, so I could back my testimony with physical proof and I also showed the texts he sent me about how he was in control the whole time and he beat me only with 20% of his strength and if he didn't I wouldn't get up again. Afterwards I went to the doctor to document all the bruises. I wanted to get back to the apartment to pack my things but we was there, so I wanted to go back to the police station to have them protect me but they have already sent a car to the apartment to question him. I went inside, we woke him up and he started babbling incoherently about how he didn't do anything and I hit him first. I packed most important stuff and downstairs I told the police that I want to go to a safe house. During the weekend there are no admissions to proper safe houses for women, so they sent me to an old school which served as a refugee camp. It was most uncomfortable as I was among men that were from the same country as my ex and they were sitting there idly observing me each time I went to and from the classroom I had to sleep in. Fortunately this situation didn't last very long, after 3 days they called the safe house and they admitted me. I had 20 EUR cash and -500 in my bank account at the time, not counting other debt he accumulated on my name. The safe house didn't charge me anything except for a small deposit to be paid when I get my next salary.

In those first 3 days in the refugee camp I was a mess, crying constantly and reading articles about narcissistic abuse. I started getting out of a fog my mind was in during my relationship due to constant psychological, verbal and financial abuse (which started long before the physical abuse). In my lowest moments I reached out to my family and friends, most in my home country, and I told them the truth and they supported me through it all. I even wrote my colleague from work that I always liked and I had an impression that he cares about me and he insisted on coming to help me get my stuff from the refugee camp to the meeting point (accompanying someone straight to the safe house is forbidden).

Since then I quit my job (this weekend is my last), paid off a portion of my debt, found a lawyer to file for a divorce and bought a ticket to my home country and I'm planning on writing me thesis there and sending it per post to the university. I've already discussed it with them and it's perfectly fine. I will take my time simply living with my parents during this time and when I'm finished I plan to move back to the country I've been living in, because ever since I got free I started enjoying simply being there again and I found myself being happy.

When I was leaving the refugee camp I gave my two teddy bears I used to hug while crying in a fetal position during my abusive relationship to two little African girls that were there with me and that had no toys at all. Seeing them hug those teddy bears and carrying them around gave me such joy and happiness that I almost cried. It was a very cathartic moment. I felt that my soul and personality is saved and that I can be free and happy again.

Living in the safe house I started taking care of myself again, in this short 3-week period I started walking a lot, already lost some weight, got a tan and started using makeup and nail polish again. All my friends at work complimented me on my changed appearance and newfound confidence.

When I was in this abusive relationship for a long time I felt my life and love shouldn't look like that but I thought I had no alternative. I will never find anyone else again, I was a mess, used goods, ugly and getting fatter. When I left and took care of myself again I felt pretty and worthy of love and attention again. I started writing my colleague from work every day for hours and going out and before I realized I fell in love with him and he confessed that he had a crush on me from the start but now as we got to know each other better outside of work he fell for me completely. I'm still cautious and sensitive because of my experience and I'm usually letting him speak his opinions about important things first to make sure he really thinks that and is not just mirroring me and I came to the conclusion that we do have the same ideas about love, life, politics, religion and so on. He's also OK with me leaving for a couple of months and he's declared that he'll be waiting for me to get back and I can even stay at his apartment while looking for a job and a place to stay when I get back from my home country.

TL;DR I went to the police, started paying off debts and fell in love with a good man in 4 weeks since leaving my abusive ex. I'm happy, full of love and hope for a better future.",2018-05-26 22:02:17

my trauma,22,jxmboj,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/jxmboj/my_trauma/,20,1605894705,"Debunking stereotypical, often racist views, about going abroad to Uganda for an internship was something I pushed for. Now after what happened I’m constantly terrified to hear, “You shouldn’t have gone to Africa.” Not only for bigots to feed their hatred, but I’m also worried it will get to my head and I will end up blaming myself.

Staying in a compound, with walls around the house with barbed wire, two guards and two guard dogs, never made me feel unsafe. Even when I wasn’t at the compound, the locals still made me feel safe enough. I witnessed the beauty Uganda offers first hand.

When our compound got broken into by eight men, earlier believed to be a gang, now believed to be locals who had this planned for a while, everything changed.

The dogs would bark often, but this time around, it sounded different. I still remember the sound of the wind through the window and the dogs running around in desperation, trying to wake us up, or maybe just trying to escape the situation themselves. I remember taking out my earplugs, being frustrated and half asleep, but soon realizing there was some trouble happening upon us. At this point me and my three friends were awake. We all slept in the same room. The flight instinct in me was real. I wanted to get out of the (gated) window.

This is where it all went downhill so fast.

My friend opened the door to see what was going on after hearing another lady in the house scream. She saw a man coming in with a bow and arrow. She ran away from the door and I locked it. The lock had just one latch and did not stand a chance.

We laid in bed two on two with each other. My one friend tried to hold onto me, trying to calm my flight instinct, since we couldn’t go anywhere. The break-in, with loads of chaos. My memory here is selective, but I remember them yelling for “Money, I want money.”

We looked for our cash, jewelry, laptops, anything they would want. We’d speak in our native language about opening the safe. My friend opened the safe but it wasn’t enough. For some reason, one guy forced me to go with him and open other people’s safes, but I didn't have the code for them. He kept yelling for me to open them, and then continued to walk with me to other rooms. Note, I quickly put on a shirt before they broke in, as I usually sleep naked.

I tried explaining while crying, I gave everything I had, and I didn’t know about other people’s stuff or safe codes. He threatened me with a sharp object to my neck, while grabbing my breast. I don’t remember what I thought, but I remember the feeling of knowing, ""I'll probably get raped sooner or later.""

He took me, hostage, in the kitchen, punching me so hard on my chin/jaw area that my tooth broke. I let out a scream. He pushed me to the ground and took off his belt and pants. I froze, tried to go along just to stay alive.

He jammed his fingers inside of me, to get me wet I think. He penetrated himself in me and demanded I would say ""Fuck me."" So I did. It still haunts me. He continued shoving his tongue down my throat.

I think this is where he realized his other monster friends were done robbing the place, so he left. I don’t remember how long it lasted, but to make myself feel better and downplay the whole thing, I keep saying ""It only lasted 5-10 minutes.""

He got out of me and said, ""You’re lucky.""

To this day, it keeps me up at night, trying to understand what made me lucky? Was I lucky that he ‘had’ to stop? Was I lucky cause he raped me? Was I lucky that he didn’t finish it by killing me? I honestly think it wouldn’t have made a difference for him, my being dead or alive.

Getting up on the floor I realized my hair was slippery from blood. I don’t know how I got the cut. Doctors assumed it happened because of a sharp item, but I don’t remember him hitting me with something. But it probably happened.

I walked up to the bathroom, where someone else from the house was waking up after being knocked out. He comforted me, apparently, as we waited a while to make sure that they were all gone. I was put down on the couch, being dressed by my friends, waiting for help.

I remember to keep telling my friends ""I need an HIV test, I need my blood tested, I need an STD test."" They put anything from the freezer on my head, and stayed with me. Others were also hurt but I won’t get into their details. It was true madness, chaos, everyone was on their own fight/flight/freeze mode. Trying to keep it together until help came. One guard almost died.

My heart never blames my friends for not ‘saving’ me from being raped, but my mind does. I just can’t help thinking, ""Where were you?"" They were trying to stay alive. How can one person possibly blame them for that? I don’t want to blame them, but in weak moments, I get frustrated and wish it went down differently.

I’ll never forget having to ask my friend to look at my vagina, because the doctors ignored me, but the blood on my leg scared me, so I didn’t dare to look at it myself.

After getting my head stitched up and a CT scan done, it took hours before the gynecologist helped me. Then it took even more hours before I was put on PEP medication. After nearly fourteen hours I got PEP medication. This was still on time, but in the aftermath of it all, trying to heal, this is frustrating. I should’ve gotten it way sooner.

It was clear the police also didn’t know what to do. They just asked me what happened and wrote down our stolen stuff, but they forgot to include my soul being stolen.

Later they looked for a nail clipper cause they remembered they probably should perform a rape kit. The officer asked me if ""I was a strong girl and scratched my attacker?"" I tried staying alive, so of course, I didn’t. He said, ""Of course you did."" And he looked for a nail clipper, not a hospital one, no, a personal nail clipper. Probably from some woman’s purse, since it was used before and had pink accents on it.

I was waiting for them to cut my nails, only to realize I had to do this part of the rape kit myself. Mind you, I was in a random waiting room, no place to put down my cut nails. Someone got a cup from the water dispenser and handed it to me, to put my nails in. I got angry at the situation, the DNA wouldn’t have been useful one bit. I threw my nails in there and shoved the cup in this cop’s hand. I wonder what they did with it.

The next day (and after a horrible night trying to stay awake because I was so afraid of nightmares) I received my ‘fit to fly’ and we flew home. Christmas 2019 was spent getting HIV tested and waiting for results. I tested negative.

I thought the hardest part would be trying to process the trauma of what happened to me, which was, don’t get me wrong, incredibly hard. But trying to pick up my life and continue living is what is hardest for me. I feel like some part of me died. Looking at old pictures of me, before what happened, doesn't feel like me anymore. Looking in the mirror doesn’t feel like me anymore. It feels like I have to mourn...me, even though I’m safe at home now.

My future feels okay until I realize I’m gonna be ‘that’ aunt. I’m gonna be ‘that’ statistic. Growing up as a woman, I don’t remember when I first learned about rape. I think it’s something most girls growing up are aware and fearful of. Weirdly, I almost believe I manifested it. I would always be afraid, in any ally alone, biking home from going out, making sure not to leave friends alone when clubbing. As a girl, I would spend a good part of my life, trying not to get raped. Now that it happened, it feels like I lost. Accepting this happened requires strength I’m not sure I have.",2020-11-20 23:21:45

I posted a while back about our company, [Bissy Energy](https://www.bissyenergy.com/) and I am back again in need of your strong support. For those of you that don't know, Bissy is a maker of delicious and healthy energy drinks that use kolanut fruit sourced from seven smallholder farmer partners in Osun State, Nigeria. It is our goal to bring some Naija culture to the US through our energy drinks while creating a market for Fair Trade goods in Nigeria. We were shocked to find that there has never been a Fair Trade certification in Nigeria with the majority of the rural population living far below the World Bank's global poverty line of $1.90; our farmers for instance live no around $1.20 - unacceptable!

The reason we need your help is because we were nominated for a $50,000 small business grant through Orgain's [Grants for Greater Good](https://orgain.com/pages/grants-for-greater-good#modal-bissy) and are in a heated battle for public votes! The top three companies in votes at the end of the day on the 25th of May will be taking home $50,000 each to advance their social mission. Here are the current vote totals as of 6:30 PM PST:

"It may not be healthy, but I'm desperately tying to understand my abuser’s pathology",7,kiq8ga,https://www.reddit.com/r/sexualassault/comments/kiq8ga/it_may_not_be_healthy_but_im_desperately_tying_to/,9,1608745546,"Mods please delete if insensitive/inappropriate… 

Trigger warning - non-consensual sex, severe abuse, racism, misogyny 

The circumstances around my rape and sexual assault have become quite the cosmic joke and in that, I’ve been trying to work out just what happened and quite \*how\* it all got so bad… 

I’m pretty sure my abuser is a sociopath/narcissist, I know he’s a criminal (drink drives/committed benefit fraud/bruised an ex so bad she went to the police), he’s misogynistic and see’s women as objects (once bragging that he managed to get a lesbian to sleep with him, and that he wanted to f\*ck a black woman as he wanted to see his white c\*ck in a black p\*ssy), and he also has ADHD. 

At the time he was trying to hire me when he “actively seduced” me (i.e. got me so blackout drunk I couldn’t consent, and actually said no), he also ejaculated on my face when I asked him not to, which we can all agree is illegal. 

He was also in a relationship at the time, and I was six weeks out of a seven year engagement with a kind man that I loved deeply, but who ultimately wasn’t a good fit for where I wanted to go in life (fit, healthy, productive, and entrepreneurial). 

My abuser (sexual, emotional, physical, almost spiritual) once said to me - “you’re a smart girl, you’ll figure it out” - and I think I finally have (3.5 years and a whole lotta abuse from him later). 

It wasn’t my fault. It was never my fault. He fucked up. BADLY. In the following ways… 

&#x200B;

1. He sexually assaulted someone he was trying to hire whilst, in a long-term relationship 
2. In order to cover up that abuse, and keep it secret from his co-founder (and risk losing his unvested shares - the company was only a few months old) and his girlfriend (who was paying his rent) he decided to “keep friends close and enemies closer” and continually allude to a relationship with me to keep me quiet
3. This led to me protecting him in every way, and becoming pretty trauma bonded to the guy as I was in complete denial as to what was going on, and this ultimately made me very ill 
4. I continued to support him and his business when I had declined their offer of full-time employment not once, not twice, but three times as something felt off (turns out I was re-traumatising myself every time I went into the office, but it was my dream career move and I was desperate to make it work)
5. When we were spending time together he - left me in a pub, left me drunk in the street, ridiculed my life goals, left me in bed, told me the \*names\* of the other women he wanted to “hook-up” with \*including\* others at the office - even when he was still with his girlfriend
6. He believes in rape myths and gender tropes like “hell hath no fury” and “she wanted it anyway” (see above re: wearing down a lesbian) 
7. The whole situation was entirely crazy making, and I told him that when he had met another woman and told me about her \*in the office\* of the \*employee wellbeing\* company he had co-founded 
8. He told me I would be “bitter” and “sad” if I told anyone what had happened
9. He threatened me with a restraining order when I was looking for work, which meant my performance wasn’t exactly good when I joined a competitor (silly idea I know but I was desperate) 
10. His new girlfriend has set up \*exactly\* the same (very niche) business as I was talking to him about founding three years ago 
11. He told me that I wasn’t “normal” and that my behaviour was “pathological” when I was experiencing a stress-induced psychosis (NOT fun)
12. Told me all of his darkest (read: criminal) secrets and expected me to keep quiet about them 

I’ve told our previous employer this year about what happened and he’s resigned/been fired and (hopefully) won’t keep his shares - worth north of a few million by now. I also reported him to the police and have started to process this shit-show of an experience, whilst levelling up and re-engaging with my life goals that had been put on hold for a few years. I also (ironically) met an incredible Nigerian partner who is everything to me that my abuser was not. 

I just look at this level of manipulation and abuse and I don’t really know how I survived it? I’ve been dissociating a lot recently which generally means I feel like I’m in a movie, and want to compulsively write about it as a way of processing it all, but this is a lot right?

No one really knows the whole story aside from me and him (and now you know part of it), what do you think? 

The irony of this all, is that he probably doesn’t remember doing half of these things as he has ADHD and lacks object consistency. 

Any words of encouragement more than appreciated to get me through the remaining few days of 2020 without completely loosing it… x",2020-12-23 23:15:46

We will continue to support programs that strengthen local security and bolster the rule of law in areas where ISWA and Boko Haram operate. Such efforts should address security sector reform which is of fundamental importance due to credible reports of poor morale and leadership in the military. We will also incorporate international humanitarian and human rights law into all military and police training.

A representative education system will be key in our strategy to combat false indoctrination and radicalization of their members.

Other sisters were stuck in countries because thier visas ran out and one particular sister was stuck in Italy.	another sister was abandoned by Kovacs and stole this sister care who  wanted to leave. It was common for property to be stolen by the order. 
	There was a death of an Italian sister who was imprisoned and not allowed to see her family she did not get medical attention and she had lung cancer. Another sister who was Polish was put in an institution against her will she called me for help. Another sister nearly died because she was bleeding internally she is American and if it was not for her doctor she would not be here today. October 4 2014  a document from the Vatican was addressing patrizi that the order she founded and other orders she started were abusive and she no longer allowed to find another order. The Vatican disbanded the order as away to avoid accountability and responsibility of the abuse committed I was stationed in Stamford new haven Waterbury and Danbury Ct as well there was a convent house in three rivers Massachusetts. I was stationed overseas in Italy and Turkey. Kovacs May still be dressed in a habit even though the Vatican said not too.

Abuja, Nigeria – 04/01/2021 - The Nigerian Ministry of Health, Department of Public Health announced today that the altcoin cryptotoken NYJA, based off the beloved and reknown “Nigerian Prince” emails of yore, will be adopted as a means to attract charitable interest to social causes such as AIDS relief for children, child literacy, and access to clean drinking water, for examples.

“Everyone is familiar with the “Nigerian Prince” meme so it just seemed natural to choose NYJA”, said agency director Doctor U.M. Ene-Obong.  “A great deal of good will come from this.  We are excited.”

NYJA, and it's community members, have already directed efforts to relief for African children stricken with AIDS with more to come.  The token price of NYJA rose 12.5% with this announcement.

My name is Oluwabusayo Adebayo!￼ I’m a senior studying Technical Systems Management at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. My partner and I have spent the last few months developing partnerships with established black professionals and corporate groups across the engineering, health, and business spaces to connect college students with **1:1 mentoring** and the associated referrals, recommendations, and internship opportunities that come with it. We’ve been able to engage black professionals at **Google, Microsoft, BMO Harris Bank, World Health Organization, Nuna, and City Health Tech** and have been invited to match as many black students as possible with the black professionals at these companies. 

One of our current mentees just got accepted into grad school at Emory University and Washington University to pursue her Master's degree in Nursing. She has been a part of our Winter cohort since January 2021 and has received weekly mentorship from her mentors and the [Voribe](https://www.voribe.com/) community. Our goal at Voribe is to replicate this same result for many other Nigerian-American students who aren't crystal clear on what career path to take. We are a non-profit organization designed to connect Nigerian-American students with industry professionals to help them discover their calling and accelerate their careers. That said, my team and I would love the opportunity to facilitate the connection between a mentee and a black professional in their respective field. 

If you have a group of black college students or Nigerian-Americans in your network that you think would appreciate the social capital of being mentored by industry professionals, please direct them to out website [here](https://www.voribe.com) to apply. Spring cohort will commence next month (April 17, 2021), so please apply ASAP. 

Thank you so much!",2021-03-21 17:18:19

"An old friend just got back in touch, told me he's a victim",3,hjzkkm,https://www.reddit.com/r/secondary_survivors/comments/hjzkkm/an_old_friend_just_got_back_in_touch_told_me_hes/,1,1593734123,"Hi,

This is a throwaway account for obvious reasons, but please believe me when I say this story is true and I am posting here for advice if at all possible.

For context, from high school/secondary school I was in a group of friends, who I still keep in touch with now, to varying degrees. Some of us speak to some of the others regularly, some only see some of the others at Christmas etc. We still chat on a group WhatsApp and have very occasional Zoom chats since lockdown started. We've known each other since the age of 12 or so, and are all approaching 40 now.

One of our group, who I'll call Paul was a very bright student in school. Very scientifically minded, so excelled in maths, physics etc. Was a genius imo. As pressure built towards our graduating exams, Paul had what appeared to be a nervous breakdown. He missed a lot of school, but still completed his exams, passed and got into college.

Some of the guys went to the same city for college (I wasn't one of them) and soon after noticed that Paul's behaviour had changed. He was drinking heavily, was binging on his meds which were prescribed to him and other various things like disappearing for days on end or going many days without sleep.

I emigrated after college so only really saw the guys at Christmas; before WhatsApp and without everyone being on FB, contact wasn't all that regular, but we'd meet at Christmas, have some beers and catch up. But it was around this time we noticed that Paul was not around as much. When he spoke he had an intensity in his eyes we had never seen before. He drank to excess.

A few years later, Paul emigrated too, to the same city I was in. I made efforts to meet him, but he would invariably cancel at the last minute. I persevered but he kept cancelling. By this stage another friend Tom had moved to the same city and had the same experience.

One by one, we got married. Paul was invited to all of the weddings but as far as I can remember he only attended one. I heard he moved to west Africa to study Islam. He had what he called a 'freak out' in the desert and had to come home. Later I found out that he had thrown his meds away as soon as he arrived in Africa.

The last I heard from him (I remember this clearly) was in 2013. He phoned me and we tried to make plans and at the end of the call he said something along the lines of ""I know I haven't been the best friend lately, but just know that we are friends"". I was deeply concerned that he would hurt himself, so contacted Tom who had a similar conversation with him. After that nobody knew where he was, his phone was disconnected and his family didn't know his whereabouts.

Then last week he followed me on Twitter. It shook me to see his profile picture. It's still Paul but he looks like the years have taken a hell of a toll on him. The day after he followed me he sent me a DM. I won't post it word for word here, but the jist was as follows.

He started by apologising for missing everyone's weddings. He explained that his mental health made him feel unwelcome.

Then he says that when he was 20 he said he'd give up seeing therapists and taking drugs, and feels he may have achieved that milestone.

Finally he opened up and said his selfishness stemmed from seeing his mother suffer drug addiction (I had no idea) and discovering that he was a rape victim.

The last part shook me to my core. I can't stop thinking about it. 

Anyway, thank you to whoever read this far. I want to message him back but am really worried about using the wrong words. I want to get back in touch with him and I genuinely hope he's ok.",2020-07-03 5:25:23

"Nigeria : Kaduna, three teachers abducted by an armed man.",2,m6vh6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/NigeriaNews/comments/m6vh6s/nigeria_kaduna_three_teachers_abducted_by_an/,0,1615997623," 

Gunmen attacked an elementary school in northwestern Kaduna state and kidnaped three teachers but no children, according to a provincial official. Fortunately no students have been abducted at the scene this time.

The attack on a motorcycle by gunmen on Monday was the latest in a series of attacks targeting schools in Nigeria, just days after nearly 40 students were abducted by bandits.

Kidnappings of educational institutions are common in Nigeria. Hundreds of children were abducted from their schools and some were killed. Reports say more than 800 students have been abducted since December. Nigerian police and authorities are cracking down on the group targeting students and educational institutions by later demanding large ransoms. It is also being hijacked by extremist groups such as Boko Haram, which has repeatedly kidnapped students and schoolgirls.

So Unlike previous reports, no students were abducted during the early morning attack on a school in Rama village, Samuel Arwan added.

According to Kaduna State Security Commissioner Samuel Aruwan, the students were abducted from the Federal College of Forestry Mechanization, Mando, in Kaduna but did not say how many students were taken.

“The police and the military are at the highest level. We are trying to contact the school authorities to find out the exact number of abducted students and then see the possibility of rescuing them unharmed and arresting the culprits. “A Kaduna police spokesman said. Ayuu is Mohammed Jalige.

The kidnappings at boarding schools were launched by the Boko Haram militant group, which abducted 270 girls from a school in Chibok in the northeast in 2014. About 100 of them have never been found. Armed gangs seeking ransom have since carried out copycat attacks.

Attempts by the military and police to crack down on gangs have had little success, while many worried state officials are exacerbating the situation by allowing hostages to be released without charge, at a cost giving or encouraging.

The crisis has become a political crisis for President MuhammaduBuhari, a retired general and former military commander who has faced growing criticism over the rise in violent crime and replaced his traditional military commanders earlier this year.",2021-03-17 21:43:43

&#x200B;

Nigeria ranks among the world’s least developed countries across a range of indicators: according to some estimates, Nigeria is home to the world’s largest population living in extreme poverty.

Our administration will work hard to accelerate Nigeria’s economic expansion and create new job opportunities. We will focus on four priority areas that would lay the foundation for the country’s transition to a new economic model that more effectively uses its large, young population and abundant natural resources to support sustainable growth and poverty reduction:

\+ Ensure policy transparency and predictability, which will be critical to reduce investment risk and promote growth outside the extractive industry  
\+ Enhance factor quality by investing in infrastructure, strengthening land tenure security, improving educational outcomes, liberalizing the trade regime and enhancing trade and transport facilitation to help develop value chains and facilitate the efficient reallocation of factors of production, making Nigeria more cost-competitive  
\+ Reduce regulatory discretion to help attract foreign and domestic investment to the non-oil sector, encourage competition, and promote formalization  
\+ Improve access to finance, which could enable new firms to compete with incumbents and allow more productive firms to scale up their operations

I suspect the morning started out as any other. It was summer... I know I would have woken early.... I know this because I always did. Maybe not as early as Ian, who had probably already been ringing our back doorbell. More of a terrible squeal than a bell really. I know beyond my parents the first person I would have seen would have been Ian; that I know as certain as any 11 year old boy knows frogs start out as tadpoles.  How?  Because we were inseparable. In fact I'm convinced to this day after Ian's mother moved to Nova Scotia a few years earlier before “the event"", she moved them both back because we drove her insane living so far apart. To this day we can go months without taking and years without seeing each other; and as Ian put it best; we just know the other is there. Somewhere close by. If not physically then otherwise.
I'll be honest. I have zero idea what I did that morning. But in general an 11 year olds day isn't so complicated.  A far cry from the busy days filled with meetings and angry customers; traffic and overcrowded subways, smog and indifference. You don't have to worry where the money is coming from for food or the next mortgage payment. Essentially, ideally, an 11 year old has no worries.... Or that's how it’s supposed to be.

I'm convinced that is how my day was going, that August day in 1982. I most likely spent the morning biking on my decked out blue BMX or taking runs down the hill on my red homemade go kart. Brakes optional!

I can't tell you if it were sunny, cloudy, raining, hell - it could have snowed for all I remember.... But I do know late that afternoon ... had it been sunny... it clouded over in a very intense and rapid way.  It's a cloud that stayed in the sky 365 days a year ... for 32 years... and counting.


Chapter 3 - Ashamed For So Long

This chapter starts off with lyrics to a Jamestown Story Song. Only because it describes how I have felt since I was 11 years old.  I conclude with the ramblings of a broken 11 year old man.

JAMESTOWN STORY
Ashamed Lyrics
""Do you know what it’s like,
Not to know what is wrong or what's right,
I've been throwing away,
The efforts I've made to leave this all behind,
Don't feel sorry for me,
I have no excuse, I brought this on myself

I, I felt ashamed, for so long,
You, you are the reason I go on

I don't know, how I got here,
I don't know, where I went wrong,
I'm the player that's aged,
And won't stay away cause,
I've been in the game for so long,
Another day, another way,
For me to finally make a change,
Another day, another slave,
But I'll keep trying,

I, I felt ashamed, for so long,

You, you are the reason I go on,
I, I felt ashamed, for so long,
You, you are the reason I go on,

I can't escape all the problems I've made for myself
I'm in hell, and accept all the blame, yeah
I can't escape all the problems I've made for myself
I'm in hell, here's the look but don't stare,
I can't escape all the problems I've made for myself
I'm in hell, and accept all the blame, yeah
I can't escape all the problems I've made for myself
I'm in hell, take a look but don't stare,

I, I felt ashamed, for so long,
You, you are the reason I go on,
I, I felt ashamed, for so long,
You, you are the reason I go on.""

There shouldn't be much else more to say..... Yet there is... Yes I have felt ashamed for so long. Puberty was confusing.  Why the hell am I like this?  Why do I always walk with my head down? ... Well that's what ashamed losers do.  Maybe I should tell someone now?  It's been 2 years.  Why go through the embarrassment? ... It's too late ... Why do I go to church? There can't be a God.  A God wouldn't let this happen to a little kid.  Why me?... Why didn't I stay home that day? ... Why did one show compassion but not two?  How come I'm alive?  Did they really know who I was?  Would they really get me?

Why did I sleep with a little jackknife under my pillow forever? (a gift from my uncle Carl) You idiot that won't protect you. Nothing will. If they want you they will find you. Anywhere you go, they will be right there. Peddle your bike faster... They are gaining. .... What was that noise?... Just the floor creaking... maybe.  I'm lost... it's dark... I'm still in the woods ... There is no moon to brighten my path... They are gaining ... Where the fuck is the moon?... I can hear them but I can't see them. ... There is no light.  The light is gone.... I wake up... Or did I?  There is still no light ... Will there ever be?  Someone help me.



Chapter 4- Fire Burning

""It seems like everyday's the same and I’m left to discover... it seems like everything is grey and there’s no colour in the world...Try to stay sober but I’m dying here...I am aware now that everything’s gonna be fine… One day... Too late …I’m in hell...I feel the dream in me expire and there’s no one left to blame it on...I hear you labeled me a liar cause I can’t seem to get this through...One day too late just as well.....I am prepared now and I am fine... again""
Merci Seether, a very deep band from South Africa

Hell is always referenced as a physical location, one of fire and brimstone; an evil domain ran by the devil, Satan, Lucifer, or whatever else you would like to call him.  It is an evil place where sinners are cast out to spend eternity.  But for me Hell is a mindset, a dark cloud that hangs over constantly here on earth. ... and I live it everyday... and I have since I was 11 years old.

I was young, so young, too young to realize that slowly day by day I was losing my grip on reality, slipping into a deep cavernous darkness, going insane, a deep, deep depression - my own Hell.  I felt different all the time, different than the other boys my age...I felt like an outsider ALL of the time.  It’s possible others did not see me as an outsider, but that is just how I felt.
I was too young to verbalize it, however I knew Satan is not a being with a red tail and pitchfork who guards the souls of the damned. I knew and still believe Satan is the person on the bus sitting next to you, he is the person in line behind or in front of you at the grocery store. Lucifer is your child’s teacher, or football coach... he is your minister, priest, Rabbi. The Devil might the volunteer who drives the church bus; he might be named Jack, Allen, Sarah or Sue.
He is impossible to spot.... because he is everywhere and could be anyone.... But what I know is he is 3 people at least...

Evil is not derived from a biblical Anti-Christ; evil lives in the minds of the ordinary people... not everyone... I am not by any means implying that... what I’m saying is evil rests dormant... until something gives way... until a switch in the mind is triggered.... I realize that now... then I was too young... then I trusted people... at 11 you take everyone at face value... well I did at 10... At 11 I started to realize that is not how the world works.

At 11 I learned to be on guard....... This was a lesson I took with me everywhere as I reached adulthood. Every day of my life, every minute of every day was in some form dark and cheerless... as for me... my Satan was 3 people who I will never know.... 3 older boys; and yes they were boys, not men that I know for sure... I won’t explain now but yes they were boys.  Thanks to them I realized evil was all around us and it was never going away.

These boys could now be lawyers, doctors, garbage men, policemen... perhaps they are all dead... They could live down the street, or perhaps another continent.
I might not have seen them, but their voices - distinct and post pubescent, are with me every waking hour... and they often seep into my dreams... nightmares that haunt me... even after I awake... they had a smell of sweat of boys who had been out in the summer heat all day... it was a combination of sweat, dirt and tree sap... whatever they used to cover my eyes tightly tied smelled like a fresh-washed spring-like flowery detergent.  It might have been a t-shirt...Eventually, alone I got it off..but I didn't even then check to see what it was... that is what it felt like.  The fact they had this and other supplies makes it more scary.... this wasn’t random spur of the moment... this was planned...They had with them what today we would call...a rape kit. Was I the target or was I at the wrong place at the wrong time?
Today, 32 years later, do they still talk about what they did? Perhaps they made a pact to take it to their graves... will one of them eventually break that pact if in fact one were to exist.
Or did they just forget it and not allow even a passing thought.  Maybe to them I was just a piece of garbage that has been put out to a virtual curb in their minds.  But I wasn’t... I was an 11 year old boy who liked to do everything any other normal 11 year old boy did...... And Then...

Have any of the 3 put the end of a 35 mm to their mouth and pulled the trigger; wrought from guilt... I've had one to my head and for some unknown reason could not gather the courage to do it.  I will never know the answer to this question... and this means one thing to me...........I will most likely never know the answer to any of the millions of questions in my mind...my mind that races 24 hours a day… every day...racing with images I guarantee nobody wants to see... but I have no choice.  So every stranger I see is Satan... every new and every familiar face holds potential evil.... This is how it is now and how I suspect it will remain.

The number of times I have wondered if any of them feel remorse is equal to the number of times I have planned out how to end my existence and eliminate my pain...

The first time I planned out a suicide I was 13 years old... the previous two years I'm sure I had no idea what suicide was... the thought never crossed my mind.. I was just scared day and night...everywhere I went...then at 13 I knew how I would stop being scared....
I sat fully clothed in the bathtub, the water running... in my hand a very sharp knife from the kitchen drawer... the one closest to the dishwasher, a yellowish colour - late 70s early 80s model...I knew what I had to do... funny how a 13 year old mind works.. I sat there with a t-shirt and jeans on because the thought of my parents or sister finding me naked was very embarrassing.... you’re going to be dead stupid... what difference does it make...and as dark and murky as the cloud was I was unable to do it.  What I eventually was able to do was cut... often... I did not do it for attention... I didn’t do it in any place noticeable... I did it for myself... because the pain helped me realize I was still alive... and I deserved pain... after all I was now a dirty little whore fagot.
Every day I put on a front as a normal teen boy... I became an expert at acting, and lying about anything and everything. I was paranoid someone would find out my secret... I didn’t want anyone to know... Jesus Christ I couldn’t let anybody find out ..........The fagot should have just died.
